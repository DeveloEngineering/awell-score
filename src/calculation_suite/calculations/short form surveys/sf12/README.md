# Short Form 12 (SF-12)

## Introduction

The SF-12 questionnaire (Short Form 12) is a general health questionnaire that allows statements to be made about the patient's state of health over 8 different dimensions. It is the short form of the Short Form 36 questionnaire (SF-36). Some patients have complained that completing 36 questions is cumbersome. Consequently, the originators of the SF-36 developed the SF-12 [1]. Using regression analysis, Ware et al [1] were able to select 12 questions from the SF-36 that reliably produced scores that mirrored those from the SF-36. 

## Questions and Scoring

The SF-12 consists of 12 items split over 8 different dimensions. The items cover:

- General health perceptions - 1 item; Excellent = 5,0; Very Good = 4,4; Good = 3,4; Fair = 2,0; Poor = 1,0
- Physical functioning - 2 items; No, not limited at all = 3; Yes, limited a little = 2; Yes, limited a lot = 1
- Role physical - 2 items; None of the time = 5; A little of the time = 4; Some of the time = 3; Most of the time = 2; All of the time = 1
- Bodily pain - 1 item; Not at all = 5; A little bit = 4; Moderately = 3; Quite a bit = 2; Extremely = 1
- Vitality - 1 item; None of the time = 1; A little of the time = 2; Some of the time = 3; Most of the time = 4; All of the time = 5
- Social functioning - 1 item; None of the time = 5; A little of the time = 4; Some of the time = 3; Most of the time = 2; All of the time = 1
- Role emotional - 2 items; None of the time = 5; A little of the time = 4; Some of the time = 3; Most of the time = 2; All of the time = 1
- Mental health - 2 items; 
    - Item 1: None of the time = 1; A little of the time = 2; Some of the time = 3; Most of the time = 4; All of the time = 5; 
    - Item 2: None of the time = 5; A little of the time = 4; Some of the time = 3; Most of the time = 2; All of the time = 1 


## Calculations

First the raw score is calculated for each dimension by adding each item score within the dimension. Next the raw score is transformed to a 0-100 scale, as follows:

Transformed scale = {(Actual raw score - lowest possible raw score)/Possible raw score range}*100

This transforms the lowest possible score to 0 and the highest to 100. Scores in between are % of the possible achieved score.

## Interpretation

Generally, highest scores indicate better outcome and lowest worse.
